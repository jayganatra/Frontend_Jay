ans-Canvas-The <canvas> element provides a drawing surface through JavaScript. 
		  -It allows you to draw graphics, animations, charts, or other visual images dynamically. 
		  -The content of the <canvas> is rendered programmatically using JavaScript.
		  
	ex-<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
		    <script>
			var c = document.getElementById('newCanvas');
			</script>

   -Unlike <canvas>, SVG content is XML-based and can be manipulated directly using CSS and JavaScript. 
   -SVG graphics are resolution-independent, meaning they look sharp at any resolution.

		ex-<svg width="200" height="100">
		  <rect x="10" y="10" width="50" height="50" fill="red"/>
		</svg>

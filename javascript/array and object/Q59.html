Array vs object defences in JS? 
ans:-
Array:-
=>An array is an ordered collection of values, where each value is identified by an index.
=>Arrays are typically used to store lists of items.
=>Elements are stored in a specific order, and each element can be accessed by its numeric index.
=>The first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.
ex-let arr = [10,20,30,40,50,"abc","xyz"]
--------------------------------------------------------------
Objects:-
=>An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key (or property) is a string (or Symbol) and each value can be any data type.
=>Objects are used to represent and store data with named properties.
=>Properties are not stored in a specific order.
=>Values are accessed using string keys (or Symbols) rather than numeric indices.
ex-let obj = {
    name : "abc",
    age : 20,
    city : "xyz",
}

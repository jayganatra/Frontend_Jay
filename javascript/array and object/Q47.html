Q.47 What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects? 
ans-The main drawback of declaring function directly in javascript object is you can't access function directly by calling it.
    if you have to use function then you must have to call that function by object.
<example->
    var obj1 = {
        value: 10,
        increment: function() {
            this.value++;
        }
    };
    
    var obj2 = {
        value: 20,
        increment: function() {
            this.value++;
        }
    };

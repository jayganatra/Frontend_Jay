Q.1 What is JavaScript. How to use it? 
 ans-A cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. 
 =>It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.
=> JavaScript is a Client Side Scripting Language.
=>JavaScript is highly useful in many fields like Web development, Desktop Application, Mobile Application, Game Development etc.
---------------------------------------------------
Q.2 How many type of Variable in JavaScript?
ans-There are two types of variables in JavaScript : 
   1 =>Using var :-
        -> It is a global declaration of variable.
        -> We can use it anywhere in the program.
        -> We can change the value of variable at run time.
        -> It's Mutable.
   2 =>Using let:-
        -> It is a local declaration of variable.
        -> We can use it anywhere in the block.
        -> It is Mutable, we can change the value of variable at run time.

    3=>Using const:-
        -> It is also local declaration of variable.
        -> We can also use it anywhere in the block of program.
        -> But we can't change value of variable, It is Unmutable.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Q.3 Define a Data Types in js?
ans-
   (i). Primitive Data Types:-

    (1)Number:Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
           Examples: 42, 3.14

    (2)String:Represents sequences of characters, used for text.
              Enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.
               Examples: 'Hello', "World", `Hello, ${name}`

    (3)Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
                Examples: true, false
    
    (4)Undefined:Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
                 Example: let x; // x is undefined

    (5)Null:Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
            Example: let y = null; // y is explicitly set to null

(ii) Non-Primitive Data Type :
                    => Non-Primitive data type contains object.
                    => Object is used to store multiple values of different type.
                    Example:-let person = {
                                            name: 'John',
                                            age: 30,
                                          };
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q-4 What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?
ans-

=>Undefined :-A variable is considered undefined when it has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
               Example:-undefined
               
                         let a;
                         console.log(a); 

=>Undeclared :-A variable is considered undeclared when it has not been declared in the current scope using var, let, or const.
                Example:-Undeclared
               console.log(b); 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q-5 What is Condition Statement?
ans-
 1. if Statement :-

 The if statement evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, the code block inside the if statement is executed.
ex- 
     let age = 18;
     if (age >= 18) {
          console.log("You are an adult.");
          }
2.if...else Statement :-

The if...else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.
ex-
     let age = 16;
     if (age >= 18) {
     console.log("You are an adult.");
     } else {
     console.log("You are a minor.");
     }
3.if...else if...else Statement :-

This statement is used to test multiple conditions. It can have multiple else if clauses to check additional conditions if the initial if condition is false.
ex-
          let score = 85;

          if (score >= 90) {
          console.log("Grade: A");
          } else if (score >= 80) {
          console.log("Grade: B");
          } else if (score >= 70) {
          console.log("Grade: C");
          } else {
          console.log("Grade: F");
          }
4.Nested If :

     ex-if(condition) {
     if(condition) {
          // code...
     }
     }
     else {
     // code...
     }
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q-6 What is the result of the expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4)? 
ans-5 > 3 evaluates to true because 5 is indeed greater than 3.
   2 < 4 evaluates to true because 2 is less than 4.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.7 What is the result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello")?
 ans-
 true && 1 && "hello":
     Both true and 1 are truthy values. The && operator returns the second operand, which is 1.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.8 What is the result of the expression true && false || false && true
ANS-The result of the expression true && false || false && true is false.3
     let result = true && false || false && true;
     console.log(result); // Output: false
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.9 What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?
ANS- Loop : Loop is defined as execute some part of code again and again until condition of loop return false.
     
     There are mainly 3 loops :
     
     (1)for Loop:Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
     Example:
               for () {
               // Code to be executed
               }
     (2)while Loop:Executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
     Example:
          while (condition) {
               // Code to be executed
          }
     (3)do...while Loop:Executes a block of code once, and then repeats the execution as long as the specified condition is true.
     Example:
          do {
               // Code to be executed
          }while (condition);
     (4)Switch Case :
          Switch case is used instead of if else if ladder.
         It's execute each case, if any case returns true than swtich will be break, otherwise execute default block code.
         
         Example:-

         switch (expression) {
          case value1:
          // Code to be executed if expression equals value1
          break;
          case value2:
          // Code to be executed if expression equals value2
          break;
          // Add more cases as needed
          default:
          // Code to be executed if no cases match
          }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q-10 What is the use of is Nan function?
ans-The isNaN() function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is Not-a-Number. 
     It is a global function that checks if the value passed to it is not a valid number.
     value: The value you want to test.
     Returns true if the value is NaN (Not-a-Number).
     isNaN(value): Checks if the value is NaN after type coercion.
     ex-
     isNaN(value)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q-11 What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?
ans-
 && operator : It's used with conditional statement and loops.
               It's used with multiple conditions.
                If both conditions are true then it'll returns TRUE.

â€¢ || operator : It's also used with conditional statement and loops.
                It's used with multiple conditions.
                If any one condition becomes true then it'll returns TRUE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q-12 What is the use of Void (0)? 
ans-void(0) is a construct used to evaluate an expression and then return undefined.
     It is used when we have to set anything undefined or return undfined.
